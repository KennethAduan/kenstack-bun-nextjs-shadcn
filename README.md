# Bun Next.js 14 with Shadcn UI, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

This is a project template created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 14, utilizing [Shadcn UI](https://shadcn-ui.com/) components, and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It also integrates [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.

## Getting Started

To begin, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start modifying the page by editing app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project utilizes next/font for automatic optimization and loading of Inter, a custom Google Font.

Database Setup
This project uses Prisma as the ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. Before running the development server, ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your machine.
